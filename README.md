# Small_autonomous_warehouse

There are several projects inside the robot code folder. m3pi_519_project is the complete set with the entire robot state machine.
The other two are used to test individual components of the robot code and hardware.
linefollow_test contains the code which was used in the demo video on Youtube.

server_program directory contains the initial TCP/IP server that was implemented. Too bad it was naught of use.  

controller_program directory contains the zigbee communication server and its related processes, the Vicon client and the controller logic in its infancy.
